System Design:-
    Application Development:-
            1.Requirement Gathering
            2.Scope
            3.MVP(Minimal Viable Product)
            4.Software development
    Web Crawler:-
         Software that crawls through data of each website and provide the data
         Uses Depth First Search Algorithm
    Google Search:
        Download all content of all the websites
        Storage: 1.87 Billion Web pages=>100*2B=200B
        size of one web page=100KB
        Total Size=100*2B=100*10^3*200B=2B*10^7 Bytes
        Total size=~20PetaBytes
        Required around 20000 machines of 1TB

        Parameters to consider for any project:
            -Requirement gathering
            -Scoping
            -Estimation of data
                compute
                storage
                network
            -Breaking the bigger problems into smaller
            -Implementation of each component
            -Testing
            -Deployment

        Low Level Design:-
            -Object Orientated principles
            -Design Principles(SOLID)
            -GOF Design Patterns

        Object Orientated Programming:-
            Object:- State + Behaviour(Instance of classes)
            Class :- Template + Blueprint Eg:-Class Person

        Encapsulation:-
            Binding state and behaviour together.
            Hiding the inner implementation of business access specifier using setters and getters

        Inheritance:-
            Extending from the parent class
            Extends class
            implement the interface
            super is used to invoke parent methods
